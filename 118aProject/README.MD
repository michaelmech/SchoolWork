The goal of this assignment was to write a paper on 3 different machine learning algorithms and their performance on three different binary classification datasets. The three datasets
I chose were the titanic survival one, one where you have to classify between grapefruit and orange, and reddit comments on the introvert and extrovert subreddits that I scraped
myself.
