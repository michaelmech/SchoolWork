There is a similar problem with all mental health subs that aren't moderated by mental health professionals.\n\n\\>Why is the only definition to you of “rational” what YOU agree with?\n\nIt's a general sentiment, you guys are certainly in the minority of the general population with this opinion. I've never even heard a person claim calling someone is a dominance move and some form of maliciousness until this thread, and a mental health professional with you as a patient would certainly steer you away from that line of thinking. Calling someone on the phone (usually a family member or friend) is not done with any intention of dominance or malice, it's initiating a conversation.

The issue is a sudden unexpected phone call, without texting first.\n\nParents often do this, especially because they still see their kids as kids and not as adults. So according to them, randomly calling up or dropping by is not viewed as an intrusion.\n\nBut kids often have to cope up with this, because it's their parents and family. Children are also often guilted into be more accommodating of older family members even if the older family member is intrusive, entitled or have no boundaries.\n\nThis is especially hell for introverts, because receiving sudden phone calls with long conversations or sudden guests for dinner during our carefully planned recharge time, throws a wrench into everything.""]"

I\'m not saying that\'s definitively what it is..but that\'s how it sounds and looks to me. same as how extroverts think I don\'t like them just because i don\'t feel the need or desire to gab with them all the time.\n\nthey just seem like they are so out of touch with their own selves that the thought of having to be alone makes them extremely uncomfortable, or even frightened. and I think if that\'s actually the case, then that\'s very, very sad.\n\ndon\'t get me wrong, I\'m an introvert and if the entire world disappeared tomorrow (like in that film ""bokeh"") I\'d go into an extreme depression. but under normal circumstances (rather normal-ish, non-apocalyptic circumstances; yes people are dying and it\'s for certain more frightening than the flu, but China for example is starting to get back to normal after a few months) it\'s a good skill to not base your self-worth entirely off of the number of people you have surrounding you or how much time you have dedicated to socializing.']"

I enjoy not having to worry about always having to plan social outings, maintain large group of friends etc and still feeling satisfied with life. However, I also envy the energy of extroverts and their feeling to be part of society, it\'s something I wish naturally had.\n\nI joined this sub looking for good discussion and sharing insight with like minded people.

0,I,"['The downside to this line of thinking is that if the people who never want to talk keep never wanting to talk, it’s reasonable for the other person to eventually stop trying to help you. This continues in a cycle of loneliness and despair. The solution is to talk, even if the other person can’t do anything to help. That way they understand where you’re coming from and it allows them to feel like there is still a connection. Humans are social beings so when humans act antisocial, it’s not logical to blame social people who are willing to help.\n\nIf someone gets angry because someone else won’t share their feelings, it’s not a selfish anger. It’s like trying to help a drowning person who’s only response is to pull you into the water with them. In life or death scenarios, rescuers are taught to knock that person unconscious or push them away until they are too desperate or tired to act out in order to prevent them from causing damage to others. That line of thinking can be applied to those who require emotional help.\n\nIt’s not an easy line to walk, but pushing away help will never make the situation better; it can merely plateau a feeling until it gets worse.']"

She suffers from depression and generalized anxiety, so it's not always within her control -- despite the fact that she has a healthy diet, exercises, meditates, and gets plenty of sleep. I also am guilty of being curt/sharp when i'm frustrated. Not always, but sometimes, and that makes her feel like I don't care and hurts her feelings. I don't do it intentionally, but sometimes it's difficult to control the tone of my voice. We just had a big fight a couple of days ago, and she said a couple of things to me that were (until that point) relatively mean and kind of out of character for her. They hit me like a ton of bricks and physically made me recoil. Now I cant be around her without hearing those words, or feeling a little bit of nausea because of my hurt feelings. I'm afraid to bring it up again because I dont want to open that can of worms again and argue again. We rarely argue and have NEVER argued like that. It was all because of a miscommunication and a lack of tact on my behalf. I'm sick to my stomach to think that these hurt feelings i've got are permanent. I just want to be able to heal my heart, and also be able to exist next to her without letting her moods affect mine. I want more than anything to have a harmonious relationship with her, where we can be strong for each other and take on any challenges together -- instead of seeing each other as the opponent.""]"
0,I,"['What you’re going through is far more common than you might think; you’re just very aware and articulate which makes it seem like a unique problem. I’m not minimizing your issue, I’m saying that it’s a real problem that happens often and has solutions.\n\nWhat you just described sounds a lot like how I used to be before I changed my views. I would start by recommending Jordan Peterson on YouTube. He’s a clinical psychologist from Toronto who has hours and hours of lectures that break down lots of modern issues and why people feel the way they do today and have since the beginning of consciousness.\n\nTone of voice is important, as well as inflection. People like myself are very easily swayed towards how we treat people based off how they sound when they talk to us (probably because my parents always fought when I was a child and they often blamed me to help forgive one another and move past it) so try and keep a calm, low voice when you think an argument might be coming. Avoid condescending and patronizing her; the goal is to show as few signs of irritation or annoyance as possible. This makes you a blank canvas for her to be herself towards. This might not be a good thing all the time, as per you specific issue but it simplified the issue because you’re not fuelling any fires or handing out ammunition.\n\nThe next thing I’d like to say is that it’s important for you to talk to her about whatever she said that hurt you so deeply. You haven’t specifically said what it is, and I don’t want you to because that tells me it’s something personal and hurtful. You need to find a good place and time to tell her that she genuinely hurt you with those words, and that you’re concerned about her current state of mind and how she deals with emotional situations because you want a future together forever and that can’t exist when one or both people aren’t trying. When my wife was my girlfriend, we had a fight over something similar to your issue and I said “If you can’t even pretend to be excited about something for me once in a  while, why would I ever do that for you? This is ridiculous and so immature.” Her reply was “well I don’t know what to tell you, maybe you should find someone else.” And I replied, “I don’t want someone else, I want *you* and I want you to be the best you can be. Right now you’re not the best you can be, and I’ll help you if you let me but I’m not giving up. If you want to give up, then give up, but love means you try.” - the point of this is that when you fight, in addition to making yourself a blank canvas, try to keep your responses filled with love. It sounds cheesy, but it will constantly remind her that you’re not there to be an enemy; you’re there to accelerate her already amazing personality.\n\nAsk her why she would say these things, and to confirm if this is truly what she means what she said. If she does, why does she feel this way and how can she justify it if she is to be your wife? If she doesn’t, then how can you help her live her life in such a way that if this chance arises for her again, *she wouldn’t take it*?']"
0,I,"['In regards to not letting her mood affect yours, *please* listen to what I’m about to tell you.\n\nBe. Her. Hero. — Every healthy woman in a relationship needs a man who is both his own person, and whomever she needs him to be. What does that mean exactly? Have a personality, be yourself. That’s who she loves. ***But*** who you are is not always who she needs. So be that too. She’s having a bad day? And you *also* had a bad day? What justifies your existence right now? Feeling bad about your day? Or helping her forget she had a bad day at all? You knew the answer the moment you read the question. It’s part of what makes a good man irresistible to a woman. We are who we are, but when she needs a fireman to put out that fire, *be her fireman*. When she needs a shoulder to cry on, *be a sea of shoulders*.\n\nWhen a woman has that kind of support, you will find yourself happier. Not just because she’s happier, but because you’re *her hero*. It’s easy to be the victim, because we all get sick and we all die eventually. It’s easy to be the villain, because we already know that life is pain and we can always make it worse. But it’s hard to be the hero, because hero’s make choices we might not think to make. They make hard choices that are not always easy.\n\nBe her hero.']"

I\'m not shy either, I genuinely love people but my strength & creativity comes from solitude.\n\nI think it can be particularly difficult for introverted performers because people do assume we must live for attention and must have boundless social energy, like the performance just magically happens. Then they\'re confused when we go home after the show and spend so much time alone. \n\nThey\'re like ""But here, I have so much more attention to give you, why don\'t you want it?"", lol\n\nI love entertaining people and bringing them a little bit of happiness in a crappy day if I can, but I\'m not dependent on attention, neither is my performance, you know? \n\nIt seems a lot of introverted folks in entertainment/performing arts struggle with this. \n\nAlso: Aerial dance is one of those things that\'s like modern magic to me, I can\'t even imagine how much focus that takes.']"

0,I,"['So there might be a long way ahead of you but I believe we all can make it.\n\nLet me first say that you don\'t fight social anxiety or any kind of anxiety by approaching it directly - you go through a series of realisations about yourself and the world and then the anxiety sort of eases of.\n\nThe most important thing for me was to stop defining myself in terms of my ego. The ego is a contruct of the psyche useful for survival and social situations but it is not all you are. In social situations usually the only thing that can get hurt is your ego - and the ego is so afraid of getting hurt that it will direct all your attention to protecting it, preventing your brain from working properly and not getting in its own way. If you let go of your ego you are no longer bothered by what other people think of you or say to you and you start to laugh at your own failures.\n\nThe ego also has a strong need to define itself, doesn\'t matter if it\'s in terms of good or bad. So it starts to define itself in terms of social anxiety. You find out that you are actually attached to your mental illness - the ego cannot imagine itself without it.\n\nThe second big thing for me was realising that often I notice people being uncomfortable around me the same way I am uncomfortable around them. But I know that I don\'t want to make others anxious. So I realised most people dont want to make me anxious as well and I can begin the interaction more relaxed as they are rarely as hostile or judging as I assume they might be.\n\n\nI suggest you read ""The wisdom of insecurity"" by Alan Watts if you haven\'t yet. It\'s a good place to start (you can also find a lot of recordings from his lectures on youtube and start there). It\'s pretty short and seemed to help a lot of people I met (and me). It doesnt tackle social anxiety directly but it will be helpful in that regard.']"
