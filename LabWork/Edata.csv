Some extroverts get joy out of putting them in the spotlight on front of everyone. I think there is a better approach than to ask a question that is already obvious, that\'s like asking ""why do you enjoy talking so loud and so much? You should talk less"".. that might be a little offensive and honestly could be worded in a different way. I think a person who is quiet already knows that they are quiet, what\'s the point of telling them ""you\'re so quiet, you should talk more"" that isn\'t really productive nor helps them talk more, in fact it makes them want to talk less. Instead, maybe try actually talking to them and ask questions about them.. preferably open ended questions because if you ask yes or no questions they will give you a yes or no answer.

So gradually that u don't realize it's happening until I'm pretty obviously in a bad spot. I have discovered that living alone is not ideal for me. Because of this I have opted to have roommates for awhile but that seemed to cause more problem of a different nature as time went on. So I got a dog. That really, really helped. I got a rescue so she needed a lot of work. She was a mastiff/lab so she needed  walks daily with a good nature hike or two weekly. Being out and about let me run into people daily and people started to look out for me and Bailey. Just getting out in nature and walking helped and having Bailey forced me to do it.  She passed away two years ago and it near killed me but when I was ready I got another big ol rescue named Darby who , remarkably, needs more work then Bailey did. When I wasn't in a position to rescue a dog going to places that had a lot of stimulation or good energy worked well, too. Places like a good, positive church, a yoga or work out class ( really highly suggest a high paced work out class, mad good energy and it works your body).  If you need more conversation that isn't going to be too intense....find a good gaming group. Not necessarily a hard core RPG but most comic book stores have a weekly board game night.

It\'s very sad how much society (and I think mostly jealous introverts) put pressure on extroverts to shut up, sit down, be quiet.  It\'s not okay.  Our personalities are just as worthy and wonderful and valid.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd I also think there\'s a particular pressure put on women to be quiet, not to be ""too loud"" that adds into things also.  As an extroverted woman, I feel like so many extrovert men will really seek us out, and then act embarassed or try to get us to quiet down, probably out of their own insecurity.  It\'s easy to fall into that trap.  I know my opinion of my personality really changed when I dated a fellow extrovert who LOVED how outgoing I was and was so proud of how I was in social settings.  There are extroverted men who will try to get an extroverted woman to be quiet too.  But it\'s so worth valuing yourself and not allowing the people who would try to change you/make you feel bad to enter your psyche.  Because extroversion is a GIFT!  There are so many statistics about extroverts making more money, having more friends, etc.  We can no longer allow people to make us feel bad about it!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut I\'m just so happy for you that you are unpacking all of that baggage... that just makes me thrilled for you!

I don\'t necessarily think romance novels say that romantic relationships are the most important things in a person\'s life, anymore than a sci-fi novel says that aliens are about to imminently invade the earth, or true crime says that we\'re all about to get murdered.  With that being said, i also feel like even if they were to say that romantic relationships are the most important thing in life- what\'s wrong with that?  Plenty of people feel that way\n\nI totally agree with you about the ""it cannot be!"" preference where it might be a boring book if two people meet and have a super easy relationship.

I love reading, thinking and researching, but doing this too long makes me restless and I need to let out my energy somewhere. For example, if I stay inside and read or study for a day, usually around 2-3 pm I feel the need to get out of the house and do something. Even though I\'d rather stay inside and keep reading, I feel like I need to let out some energy.\n\nHowever, letting out energy does not mean that I need to be with people. I could play the drums by myself for an hour and then feel better. I love being outside and spending time in nature. I do not really like big social events. For me, the highlight of a party or social gathering is when I sit down with one of my best friends and just have a good conversation, away from the others. I do not mind being with people, but I do eventually get tired of them. I am also not very outgoing, but prefer to stick to the people I know.\n\nI don\'t know if this is related, but I love thinking my thoughts. However, my thought pattern is very disjointed, and I can never really stay deep in thought, because I keep becoming aware of the fact that I am thinking and then I can\'t really go back to the thought I had. I have to concentrate very hard to properly finish a train of thought... I can be quite talkative when I am interested in a topic, but I really dislike small talk. I do not enjoy voicing my opinion all the time, but will do so if no one else will. Also, its hard for me to properly ""think"" before I speak, due to my highly disjointed thought pattern, and so speaking or writing in my diary helps me organise my thoughts.\n\nAs you can see, I am neither fully introverted or extroverted. It is a comfort to know that you are not ""an introvert or an extrovert"". Originally, the introversion/extroversion was designed as a scale, with introversion and extroversion at each extreme.

Like a cooking or art class or watching a play. It makes them feel less like the entire thing is about talking. As a person with a ton of introvert friends this works best for me. It may take forever to reach a deep connection with them but they're more comfortable with the long game so they dont get overwhelmed.\n\nAs an extrovert you need to find your tribe so you can also try to find activities you can join where you may find other extroverts.

Not only do I not know anyone in my hometown (I didn\'t have many friends in high school, as I had pretty big issues with social anxiety at the time, and the friends I had here have all moved away), but it\'s also a huge adjustment to go from a college setting where I could walk out of a practice room at 2 in the morning and find a group of people just chilling in the building. I imagine this might be a similar adjustment to transferring, but I\'m not sure.\n\nThe thing is, the friends I\'ve had have always been people that I was working or collaborating with, and it\'s a totally different challenge to develop friendships with people that you aren\'t forced to be around! That might be partially due to some residual self-worth issues on my part, but regardless, it still takes a lot more initiative: **initiative that it is hard to have the energy for if you aren\'t already spending time with people!** It seems kind of like starting a car rather than shifting gears if that analogy makes sense.\n\nIf you can find any clubs or groups on campus, that would be a good place to try because there is already an implicit common interest and stuff. If you have no dice with that, it would be worth checking out community organizations of your choice and see what kind of events or groups you could get involved in. The key is anything that has you spending time with the same (or similar) group of people on a regular basis (weekly, monthly even).

0,E,"['>Do extroverts ever spend time alone reflecting on life and enjoy that time alone?\n\nOf course. Some of us just need way less recharge time than introverts. I\'m extroverted but enjoy going to restaurants by myself. It is a great relief to be in my own company without having to cater to or bicker with someone on where to eat, especially when I want to try new cuisines. \n\n>I see that some extroverts can\'t stand being alone and look down on people who are out and about doing things alone. Like have you ever just watched the sunset at the park alone, and sat down thinking about it and life and enjoy the peace and quiet?\n\nAs far as looking down on others, are you sure it is not you projecting what others may be thinking because you are somehow embarrassed about spending time alone? Most people are too absorbed in their own thoughts or lives to care what a random stranger is doing by themselves. I notice introverts tend to enjoy people watching and fixating on why a person does this or that, so it is very likely your perception of ""they must think I\'m a loser"" could be you thinking others are people-watching you? As far as extroverts that can\'t STAND being alone, there may be something unhealthy going on there mentally and they do not know how to cope. Some people learn later than others how to be self-aware. \n\n>My second question is have you (as an extrovert) met another super duper extrovert that is much more extroverted than you, and have you ever felt overwhelmed by them and their super bubbly personality and high strung personality? \n\nOh god yes. Extroverts are also on a spectrum from mild to extreme. It is rare for me to encounter someone even more extroverted, but when I do, I react like an agitated cat. It is much harder to hide these agitated feelings because sometimes extroverts wear their emotions on their sleeve, so I have had to occasionally apologize for my grumpy reactions. \n\n>How do you feel about someone who is super extroverted but also annoying, how do you deal with it?\n\nIt depends on their intent. If a person seems genuinely nice, I try to communicate my feelings with them and say, ""I have not had my coffee yet, can I follow up with you in a few minutes?"" And then I actually follow up. It is much easier to deal with an annoying person on your own time, instead of leaving them hanging and inevitably coming around to annoy you when you least want them to. If I really really don\'t want to talk to someone, I will find an excuse to bail from the conversation before it begins. Guy at work wants to try to hit on me (ew, I\'m married, go away)? What a coincidence, I was about to get up for water/pee/water my plants as he approaches my desk. If I\'m on a mission and don\'t have time to answer chatty Kathy\'s ""how was your weekend?,"" I say ""it was good"" and keep walking. I can tell sometimes these same people are jealous for my attention when I stop and chat with my favorite friends at work, but my time is precious and I\'m not going to waste it on someone I don\'t have things in common with or that bring me no joy in conversation. \n\nTl;dr: We are not as different as you may expect.\n\nEDIT: Spelling and rephrasing for clarity.']"

That’s not always a bad thing, since a lot of extroverts spend enough time around people to learn how to read the mood.

He has TBI (traumatic brain injury), and as the years progressed, he became crueler and crueler. He would leave me alone on holidays, eventually to go see another woman.

I new very little about the personality trait, until dating her. So I have done hours of research on it.\n\nIts quite difficult to adapt to her need for space sometimes, especially considering how much I love her company. I have tried really hard to fill my time with my passions and its helped. Finding emotional independence is difficult though, especially if you are a natural people pleaser.\n\nMy gf works with the elderly, so she is often very drained by that. She will go home and need the night to herself - esesentailly no contact. Whats hard for me is the concept that I could be ""draining"" or that its difficult for her to text a little bit in the evenings. Im not ""people"" or a large crowd. I\'d be happy just to sit in her presence. It also means I dont get to tell her about my day or hear abour hers.\n\nIts an ongoing challenge, but im.hopeful ']"

I love my SO so much but sometimes, when he's away, I feel like I'm not worth anything to him.

It made me sad that he wouldn't check if I was okay even if we have other means to communicate beside the app that we mostly use to talk. He said that he was so sure that I'd be back anyway so he wouldn't be so worried about me disappearing.\n\nWe're currently on LDR so moving in would probably be not a problem for us right now. He also initially hated the idea of marriage when we first talked about it but he said he would do it because it's important to me. When he said that, I honestly felt sad. I kind of interpreted it as 'I'm only marrying you because you want to be married,' not really because I want to be married. I do not want, in any way, force him to marry me just because I want to. I want him to want it too.\n\nJust awhile ago we had another disagreement. I said that it would probably make me happy if he posted something about us (and how it feels nice to be appreciated or acknowledged), even just here on Reddit if he wanted to be anonymous.

Most people are wrapped up in their own lives, and lots of people are introverts also, which means they might not even be open or wanting social interaction.  I also think making friends is wayyyyy harder when you enter a college in the later years.  I took two years off school, and left a really thriving social life to return home for 2 years.  When I came back, I figured I\'d just make friends like I had before.  But it was so different- everyone already had their groups, and they werent looking to add.  It\'s totally different from being an incoming freshman where no one knows anyone and everyone is new on campus and away from home and looking to bond.  I also think it\'s a generational thing- i feel bad for Generation Z because I think it\'s insane how much socialization is done online now.  I\'m a millennial but I feel like we still had more face to face interaction now, and Gen Z, because they dont do it as much, arent as good at it.  So even if you have a really friendly, outgoing, nice person, they might not even know how to react- it might intimidate them or make them nervous.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy advice would be to read ""How To Win Friends And Influence People"" and just make sure you\'re not doing anything too obnoxious, like only talking about yourself.  After that, just keep putting yourself out there.  I do think certain cities are more social than others.  The south is pretty known for friendliness, whereas, say, the PNW is known for social isolation.  So try to get yourself in a place where people will be amenable to your extroversion.  And from there, I mean I\'m a Christian so my advice would be to pray and ask God and just keep being friendly.  It takes time to make new friends in any place at all, so dont beat yourself up for not having it immediately.  You just have to keep at it and wait for the right people to enter your life :D']"

My \\[29/f\\] boyfriend \\[32/m\\] is very introverted, and wanted to start implementing a ""day to ourselves"" once a week (he works on weekends, so I can only see him during the week). I see alone time as literally physically and emotionally painful, due to reasons I\'ll list below, and we\'re trying this method of ""exposure"" therapy to show me that just because he takes a day to himself, doesn\'t mean he will go anywhere. That everything is fine, and there\'s no reason to freak out.\n\nIt\'s not that I don\'t see the benefits, but it\'s always so saddening to see the interest and the battery die in your partner\'s eyes. It\'s just a really odd thing to me...go 48 hours without seeing me and he\'s all over me. Stay at his house for 48-72 hours and I see his anxiety and his distance begin, I\'m draining his introvert battery but he doesn\'t want to tell me that and hurt my feelings.\n\nHe doesn\'t need to, I can see it plain as day.\n\nJust feeling jaded today, my partner is a wonderful man. I guess it just kind of hurts to imagine that your partner is *relieved* that you\'re not around. I have very negative associations with being alone, or being left alone to get lost in my own head. I was married before to an abusive man, and he neglected me horribly, in addition he was mentally, emotionally and borderline physically abusive. Being left alone for such a large part of my adult life was horrible. \n\nSo now, I have an amazing, nurturing relationship, but it seems that my loved one can only stay super connected for two days or so in a row, tops. \n\nJust worries me for the future. We\'ve talked about living together down the road, but honestly if I can\'t stay at his house for two days in a row without seeing his battery so drained, how the hell do introverts ever live with their non-introverted romantic partners?\n\nToday was one of our ""me time"" days, and even though he texted me throughout the whole day, checking in on me and just chatting, I feel horrendously resentful. It\'s not his fault, I know that. I just wish swimming in my own head didn\'t make me feel so lost. I\'m sure some extroverts experience this when their introverted partners go away to recharge their batteries, especially women (as we often thrive on face-to-face connection). It\'s physically painful, it causes the worst tugging in my stomach,\n\nI am feeling very pessimistic today, so pardon my gloomy attitude. My depression makes this worse; when I\'m alone, I\'m reminded of all the horrible things I\'ve endured to get here. I\'m reminded of the person I wanted so badly to be, but due to all the trauma I\'ve gone through, I failed in that endeavor as well.\n\nThis is more detail than you asked, so I do apologize. I think the fact that it will be several years before we can ever live together really makes the entire thing doubly painful for me. My partner\'s hermit identical twin lives with him, and shows no signs of wanting a life separate from my BF. He isn\'t interested in dating, refuses to get his license, doesn\'t like to leave the house except for work, but my BF refuses to have the uncomfortable heart to heart with him about what plans to do with his life. He swears he wants to live together and build a life under one roof, without his twin living in the same household, but with his introverted tendencies and his hatred of ""rocking the boat"", days like this feel so hopeless.']"

When I\'m with someone I trust, I prefer to talk about my problem in a manner that\'s as logical and constructive as possible, I may even downplay its severity. I don\'t want to burden anyone with my troubles.\n2. Crowds don\'t really mean anything to me, personally. I just want to be with people whose presence I enjoy, whether they\'re a real friend or just a fun acquaintance. \n3. Lots of things. I\'ve got interests that none of my friends share, so I explore them when I\'m alone. I watch TV shows/movies, I concentrate on my writing. Sometimes I despair over personal problems, lol, other times I just daydream/fantasize about the future that I hope awaits me. Not every moment I spend alone is insufferable for me, lol.\n4. Depends on the situation. If I want to go clubbing, the bigger the crowd, the better! If I want to hang out with friends in a cafe/grab dinner and talk about something fun, I do it with a small group of people who get along. If I want to talk about more personal things, one on one is ideal.\n5. If it\'s a random person I don\'t care about, I\'d shrug it off. If it comes from someone I care about, the delivery is important. If they\'re being nice and constructive about it, I\'ll listen and take their opinion into account. If they\'re being an asshole about it, I\'ll hide from them the criticized part of me in the future.\n6. I\'m usually the one to ask people about themselves. It seems that most people prefer to talk about themselves and rarely ask questions about others. It saddens me, as I like to think of myself as a good listener, so it\'s one of my favorite ways to filter out self-centered people.\n7. I do prefer the company of fellow extroverts, because we seem to agree on the ""rules of friendship"" that I find important. That being said, I\'d never reject the friendship offered to me by an introvert if I feel that we\'re getting along.

0,E,"['Personally, I tend not to ask people questions about themselves. It doesn\'t mean I\'m not interested, although it can mean that. But I know that I tend to think two things and operate accordingly: \n\n1) I am fairly private, especially with people I don\'t really know well (so, that doesn\'t apply to family, but it definitely applies at work in most cases--right now, I have a job where I\'m very comfortable with the boss and another co-worker...which started from their asking me a lot of questions...so this job is kind of an exception). I tend to have a rule set or code for stuff you don\'t ask people you\'re not that close to/don\'t know well or something along those lines, and I think a lot of introverts question the sincerity of ""small talk"" like ""how was your day?"" and ""how was your weekend""--I 100% do, and one of my many, many questions for extroverts is **do you seriously care when you ask people this kind of stuff**.(?) Frankly, I don\'t, most of the time--I know that might sound bad, but it\'s just true. Not to say there aren\'t introverts who ask those types of questions or who care.\n\n2) But also, being private myself, I try to automatically respect other people\'s privacy and approach learning more about them more freestyle, i.e. I\'ll let them volunteer info or tell me whatever they want to, and I\'ll listen. And usually this is what people do, I think--especially extroverts. I am sure a lot of the extroverts I\'ve been around think I don\'t know anything about them, but I always learn a lot about them because I hear their conversations with other people--even when they think I\'m not listening/paying attention (this is a really big one)--and I remember stuff they volunteer directly to me. Even though I don\'t ask people questions/they ask me more questions about myself than vice versa, I definitely end up knowing more about them than they do about me. ']"
0,E,"['Of course I don’t mind :) But please, bear in mind that I can speak strictly from my experience which is purely anecdotal, so I’m generalizing based on that. I’m sure that there are all kinds of introverts out there.\n\nSo, to me, friendship is a two-way street, but from my experience, introverts prefer not to initiate stuff. Maybe they feel anxious, maybe they don’t want to “bother” me, but nobody likes bothering others and we all prefer it when others show that they like us by initiating. So if I’m always forced to initiate, it’s unavoidable that I’d feel like the other party is not interested in my friendship. That is less likely to happen with other extroverts in my life.\n\nThen there’s a matter of preference. Most introverts I’ve known tend to prefer staying at home as opposed to going out. I don’t mind, I like watching movies, TV shows and stuff, but too much of that would drive me crazy, hahah. I like getting all dolled up and going out. I like meeting friends’ friends and introducing my friends to other people, but introverts tend to avoid associating with my other friends, maybe it’s out of shyness, maybe it’s because they prefer to have a limited number of friends, who knows. But, of course, I respect their boundaries and I don’t drag them outside.\n\nThirdly, self-preservation. It’s very painful when an extrovert grows attached to an introvert. I want to talk to them and be around them all the time, but even if they share the sentiment, they just can’t handle the amount of socialization that I need from them. So I leave them alone and suffer in silence, lol. Society is rightfully paying a lot of attention to introverts these days, educating us on how we should take care of them and respect their boundaries, but I feel like few care about explaining the other side of the coin. I know not to bother an introvert who needs to be alone, but I think that most introverts wouldn’t think of throwing me a party when I feel lonely. \n\nSo these are some of my reasons. Again, they’re completely based on anecdotal experience, which could very well be circumstantial. ']"

I can\'t understand it at all, and I\'m sure a lot of other introverts can\'t, either. It feels like everywhere I go, I\'m the only person who is not at least ambiverted (which, for me, is usually enough for me to still end up being the ""weird"" one or too different from everyone else, and it usually seems like the ambiverts and extroverts don\'t have issues meshing with each other). I will say, though, that I\'ve realized recently that a lot of extroverts can mis-read ambiverts as introverts. So, maybe that\'s one reason why some of us feel like we\'re outnumbered, whether we\'re introverted or extroverted. I really think the average person is an ambivert. \n\n>I’m just sad because people sometimes take advantage of the fact that  **I’m interested in hearing about them** so they talk about themselves  non-stop without ever bothering to get to know me, so I’m treated as a  free therapist and that sucks. **Expressing interest in others and being  willing to share about oneself** is a key to building successful  communication with people, I’ve found. :)  \n\nI don\'t know the best way to put this...this is another thing about extroverts that I have a hard time understanding or relating to (the bolded parts). And I\'ve been thinking about this a lot, and it\'s definitely something I\'d really love to get deep into with an extrovert because I think there\'s a lot to this and it probably is one of the biggest things that make introverts and extroverts different (not all of us, but some). \n\nI can only speak for me definitively--even if I suspect many other introverts feel similarly--and it\'s probably another thing that makes me look bad, but...I have to say that I have no real innate interest in hearing about other people or expressing interest in other people. The fact that I keep seeing so many extroverts repeat this idea that they are genuinely interested in other people is just mind-blowing to me because...I\'m just not like that at all and, thus, can\'t imagine another person seriously being like that and being honest when they say that. I\'m not saying you guys aren\'t being honest when you say it; I\'m saying I can\'t even begin to put myself in your shoes and imagine when it comes to that. Now, I can feel this interest in *specific/particular* people. But not as many people as extroverts make it sound like they\'re interested in.\n\nI do have reasons to question the sincerity of it, though--the main one being that **it just seems relatively rare to encounter people who genuinely seem interested in hearing about others/expressing interest in others**. And some of that is about my life experience. I feel like I\'ve spent the majority of my life being socially ignored, and when that wasn\'t the case a lot of the attention was negative. So, now, having more people in my face acting interested in learning about me--sometimes being in environments where *everyone* is like this--and acting like I\'m supposed to do the same, getting offended when I don\'t act the same way or when I feel a little suspicious is remarkably confusing and I don\'t know what to do with it/think about it. I also tend to feel like a lot of these people would have completely ignored me 10+ years ago. So, why the interest in everybody/me **now**, you know? \n\nIn other words, why haven\'t most extroverts I\'ve encountered *always* acted interested in as many people as it seems like *they say* they are interested in, in my experience. My experience in life has always told me that people pick whom they\'re interested in getting to know and share with, and that\'s not *everybody* or even *most* people in any one environment. Most of the time, it has been ""cliques."" I feel like the rules changed somewhere along the way and now we\'re all ""supposed"" to be interested in and share with everyone else, and something\'s wrong if you\'re not like that. \n\nDon\'t know if that makes any sense how I explained it.\n\nAs to my lack of interest, which I do suspect is more of an extrovert/introvert difference--the best way I\'ve come up with to explain it is this: \n\nWe\'re in a work environment, and there are 10 of us. Extroverts make it seem like they would probably be interested in getting to know all 9 of their co-workers (for reasons that I don\'t understand/can\'t relate to--again, rules seemed to change somewhere along the way). For me, I\'ll probably feel fairly neutral to, usually, 8 of these co-workers. At best, I will be interested in actively learning more about one of them, and it\'s almost always because I just naturally feel a connection or spark with them, I like the way they interact with me or because of something they\'ve said (they\'re usually extroverts, too). I tend to have a social threshold, and it\'s basically two people--more than that is too many, especially in a work environment. If I became friends with 9 people at work or tried to actively learn about 9 people at work, I think it\'d be kind of **overwhelming or would definitely distract me away from my work**. I also know that some introverts would have a hard time imagining forming the type of depth and quality of interaction or relationship with 9 different people in one setting that they might typically prefer.\n\nAs for why some people might talk and talk about themselves when you show interest...it might go back to the idea I expressed that people rarely seem to do this genuinely. So, it\'s almost like asking for the flood gates to open when you do. I know that I have very few people to talk to and think no one is ever interested in knowing anything about me or what\'s going on with me--like I said, I really do tend to question people\'s sincerity when they show otherwise. So, with some people, if they think you\'re genuinely interested...they\'re starving, so they\'re eating everything in sight.\n\nMy response to u/dylanatastic provides the rest of my perspective on not bothering getting to know you.

0,E,"['Thank you for all of your responses. They are helpful and thought-provoking.\n\n>I want to talk to them and be around them all the time, but even if they  share the sentiment, they just can’t handle the amount of socialization  that I need from them.  \n\nPersonally, I can handle the amount of socialization an extrovert might want--just not really the *type*. And a lot of introverts would differ on this, for sure--I\'ve seen that over at r/introvert. But if I really, really like you and we\'re on the same intellectual/conversational wavelength, I can spend so much time with you and interact quite a bit. What I can\'t do is, as you mentioned, all the going out and all this meeting other people and big groups of people. I\'d prefer it just be you and me. And it doesn\'t have to be in the house watching Netflix (I actually almost never use Netflix). We can go out to a restaurant or bar or whatever, but I just don\'t want it to be a group thing, and I don\'t want it to turn into your ignoring me to meet other people, talk to other people, invite other people to be with us, etc (not that you\'d see it as ignoring me or my not being enough, but I would). As I mentioned before, I have a social threshold, and at some point the more is not the merrier for me--it\'s overwhelming, it\'s ""okay, you officially don\'t need me here now,"" it\'s ""I\'m not talking because good luck getting a word in/being heard,"" it\'s not intimate or quality time, etc. And, for me, listening to other people talk, laugh, have a good time, etc, does become draining after a while--especially when it\'s a lot of small talk, a lot of silly/goofy talk, etc, which seems like is what happens when you get bigger groups of people. \n\nThrowing you a party to cheer you up or help you not be lonely is, for me, a matter of not even wanting to be there as opposed to not thinking of it. Like, I\'d have to plan it and set it up for you and then get the hell out of there, lol. Even inviting people to it for you is cringe for me. I mean, I\'m tempted to say it\'s easier for you to give me alone time than for me to throw a party for you and then be there. Again, not every introvert agrees--some can do parties, just maybe can\'t stay more than a couple of hours. But, for me, definitely, I am not interested in being at a party or even party planning.\n\nI understand why you\'d prefer or find it easier to be friends with other extroverts, though. There is an extrovert I am interested in being friends with, but I don\'t initiate with her or anything in part because I am also concerned about some of your points, as well as some of mine. I just don\'t think we\'d necessarily want to spend the same *type* of time with each other. But if it were just her and me, yeah, I\'d love to be around her and talk to her a lot. ']"
0,E,"['I\'m really sorry, the comment is a bit long so by the time I reached the end, I might have forgotten some of your main points from the beginning, so let\'s see if I understood you correctly - I think you said that you can\'t understand why people would be genuinely interested in getting to know so many other people, and for the good chunk of those who claim to be like that you suspect that they\'re not being honest, am I correct?\n\nPersonally, I love people. It seems to be a very popular mindset these days that people suck, that people are evil, animals are better than people, etc, etc. I don\'t agree with any of these sentiments. Sure, like everyone else, I\'ve been hurt by people, many times, probably more than an average introvert simply because of the amount of people I interact with every day. Still, I can\'t ignore all the wonderful things people have done for me. I think that many people make the mistake of judging others based on their bad sides and forget to take into account their good sides. That\'s why I divide the people I know into true friends, friends, fun acquaintances and the people I dislike but share a civil conversation with from time to time. True friends know everything about me. Friends are the people I care deeply about but can\'t be completely honest with because some of their personality traits make that impossible. Fun acquaintances are the people I don\'t confide in or share a particularly deep bond with, but they\'re fun to chill with every once in a while. Needless to say, I genuinely care about being surrounded with many people who enjoy my company, no matter the level of intimacy we share. And I want there to be more of those people. Not because I want to be ""popular"" or what not. But because you simply don\'t know when you\'re going to need a friend. Somebody always knows somebody who might be able to help me with something. And of course, I\'m always ready to help them back. That\'s called building a community in which everyone is always there for one another. That is why I care about getting to know people. You can\'t know if they\'re good people unless you try to get to know them :)\n\n> I feel like I\'ve spent the majority of my life being socially ignored, and when that wasn\'t the case a lot of the attention was negative. \n\nI\'m sorry to hear that. I don\'t know exactly what you would define as ignoring, but if you\'re saying that people rarely initiate conversation with you, it might have something to do with the front you put up. Maybe you give out subtle signs that you\'re not interested in making friends so people prefer not to bother you. I don\'t understand why that would make anyone give you negative attention, though. Some people are just jerks.\n\n> So, now, having more people in my face acting interested in learning about me--sometimes being in environments where *everyone* is like this--and acting like I\'m supposed to do the same, getting offended when I don\'t act the same way or when I feel a little suspicious is remarkably confusing and I don\'t know what to do with it/think about it. \n\nI\'m guessing you\'re an adult now. That basically means welcome to the world of networking, lol. Many people would try and get to know you simply for the sake of seeing if you\'re friendship material. Personally, if I notice that the other person isn\'t interested, I leave them alone. Maybe some people need to be told off directly, lol.\n\nSorry for making you read this much, lol']"
0,E,"["">Personally, I can handle the amount of socialization an extrovert might want--just not really the *type*.\n\nThat's fine. We're talking about a situation in which we like the other person a lot, and in that case, just being with them is enough, the place is less important.\n\nIt's okay if you don't feel comfortable in groups. It depends on the kind of people you're with, but from my experience, group hangouts aren't that chaotic :) It's usually people taking turns speaking, sometimes the group gets divided into subgroups when some people are more interested in one topic, while the others care more about something else, etc. It rarely gets to the point where people have to compete to get a word in, lol.\n\n>I mean, I'm tempted to say it's easier for you to give me alone time than for me to throw a party for you and then be there.\n\nYet, for me, it's the opposite, hahah. Just checking on a few people, seeing if they're free for a casual hangout is a piece of cake for me, while sitting alone in my room, feeling lonely and insecure because I want to see a friend who doesn't want to see me sounds terrible. It's all a matter of perspective and how much you care about putting the needs of the person you care about before your own.\n\n>There is an extrovert I am interested in being friends with, but I don't initiate with her or anything in part because I am also concerned about some of your points\n\nYou should keep my points in mind, but they shouldn't stop you anyway. You don't know what kind of person she is, you might find it easy to change some of your ways for her, same as how she might find it easy to change some of her ways for you, so you two can meet each other halfway. In every friendship, such situations may occur. It's up to you to try and see if she's worth it, and you won't know that unless you try to get to know her. It's totally your choice, though. Good luck anyway!""]"
0,E,"['I don\'t mind long comments.\n\nSo, let\'s put it this way: I\'m almost 38 years old. When I say I was socially ignored and, when I wasn\'t, I was receiving negative attention...I mean mostly during the school years. I think a lot of what you\'re socialized into being and believing happens during that time, so I could never really think like you at this point in terms of people being good, wanting to build communities, people being there for each other, etc, because that was never my experience for over 20 years of my life (I officially finished school at 27 because I have a graduate degree) and those years coinciding with the most formative years of my life. I was basically saying in my post, without wanting to be specific about my age, that I feel like most people--even people who say they love people and love getting to know people today in their 20s and 30s--didn\'t act that way when we were all in school. They showed interest in certain people...and now many of them seem to have a problem when other people only show interest in certain people vs in people in general. \n\nThis may or may not be all that related to introversion, but I could definitely see other introverts having a similar issue just because a lot of us grow up with people pointing out how different we are...and people who are perceived as different in school are usually less accepted. A common point-out is how quiet we are--not that all introverts are quiet, but a lot of introverts are. In any case of events, I\'m not going to change how I do things because other people have now decided, ""Welp, we\'re now adults and we now want to network...so let\'s show interest in people we never would have before **now that it seems to benefit us somehow** and then act like it\'s a natural personality trait that everyone should strive for or already has, or like only extroverts have it."" \n\nAnd I\'m sorry for how that might come off, and I don\'t know you...so I don\'t know how you acted with people as a kid, teen or early 20-something. **My point is not to say this is definitely what extroverts do; I\'m saying it\'s how it** ***feels*** **to me, i.e. it feels like extroverts are ""interested"" in people as adults because of how it benefits them and not because they\'re just naturally interested**. And there doesn\'t have to be anything wrong with that, just like there shouldn\'t be anything wrong with my being interested in a few people...but, if true, people should just be real about it instead of making it something it\'s not and shaming other people for not feeling the same way. If I\'m wrong, I want to politely know that, too, lol.\n\nI\'m also saying that I suspect a key difference between the majority of introverts and the majority of extroverts is introverts naturally not being interested in ""people"" vs extroverts at least saying they are naturally interested in ""people."" Introverts typically are interested in a *limited* number of people, I\'d say. For me, you don\'t get my attention just by being a living, breathing person--you have to strike my interest somehow. For most introverts, getting to know people takes a ton of energy--we don\'t gain energy by getting to know people like extroverts do. In work environments, where I seem to run into the most problems because I don\'t want to get to know everyone or don\'t put effort into that, this is especially true just because so many other things at work also drain my energy and take up my time. The more people thrown into the mix, the more draining it is. \n\nI hope this all makes sense. And again, thank you for your great responses--I really appreciate them. ']"

I just think this is one of those things where extroverts don\'t know what it\'s like to be an introvert in these situations because, as extroverts, they don\'t experience these issues. It\'s not like I\'ve never been in them and avoid them because I *think* this is what\'s going to happen. This is what actually has happened. \n\nBasically, for a lot of us introverts, when we\'re around a lot of people, we find ourselves around a lot of extroverts and ambiverts who dominate conversations, don\'t take pauses before jumping in with their comments and who talk over us when we try to speak up, and then they don\'t realize that\'s what has been happening or they wonder why we\'ve been so quiet. We\'ve been so quiet because we\'re not going to try and talk over other people and we try to wait for a pause before speaking, and/or because we don\'t think as fast as extroverts and ambiverts so they move on in the conversation before we have fully formulated a response. At work, I\'m also aware that time is a factor, so while other people are jumping in first and speaking, it gets later and later and I realize I don\'t want to drag out the meeting/conversation when work needs to get done. So, that\'s why it\'s not chaotic to you, i.e. you\'re not the one it\'s happening to. And there\'s no competing because we\'re not going to compete, usually.\n\nNot blaming extroverts...just saying that because we take different approaches to ""our turn"" to talk and stuff like that, the extroverts\' approach is more aggressive so they get to talk more. And most of us have been in that situation enough to know to just sit/stand there and be quiet, lol. \n\nI also want to try and be more clear about being friends with extroverts and groups...because I want extroverts to understand it\'s not always about ""comfort."" Most of the time, I think it\'s about 1) groups draining introverts whereas they energize extroverts, and 2) the more people come into the mix, the more the quality of interaction seems to go down. If I invite an extroverted friend out, that means I just want to hang out with him or her and have quality time and quality conversation. I am not in any way viewing it as a group opportunity or chance to meet others. My extroverted friend is enough for me, and my focus will be 100% on that person and I want the same back. So, it can be kind of offensive when extroverts want to bring other people into the mix. \n\n> Just checking on a few people, seeing if they\'re free for a casual  hangout is a piece of cake for me, while sitting alone in my room,  feeling lonely and insecure because I want to see a friend who doesn\'t  want to see me sounds terrible. \n\nTo me, a casual hangout is different from planning a party for you, though. If I want to make you feel less lonely, there might be things I will try and do for you--and I\'d want them to be one-on-one, to be honest--but a party will not be one of them.\n\nI can\'t speak for other introverts, but for me there would never be a time I\'d feel like I don\'t *want* to see a friend if I really do consider you a friend. For me, it\'s always more about ""okay, what does this friend want the two of us to do"" and ""okay, how many people are going to be there?"" And those types of things are what will get you a yes or no, other than stuff like being sick/tired/angry, or just feeling like I need to be alone after having been around a bunch of people all day. It\'s interesting you mention feeling lonely and insecure because a friend doesn\'t want to see you, though, because I feel like I\'m learning that extroverts feel rejected by introverts a lot when rejection was not meant **at all**. I do think that is an issue I\'ve run into recently, only not with friends but with co-workers. \n\nThanks again. ']"

Introverts typically are interested in a *limited* number of people \n\nHm, I think I didn\'t explain my side well enough when I talked about my interest in people. It\'s not that I care about getting to know every person in the world. For me, as long as someone is nice, friendly and willing to engage in a conversation, that is reason enough to give them a chance to see if they\'re friendship material. I just think it\'s a waste to wait around for an opportunity for someone to reveal a personality trait that could make them interesting to me, as it\'s mostly based on circumstance and that opportunity may never come. \n\n> I mean mostly during the school years.

You might find it hard to believe, but I was actually bullied a lot in elementary school. Everything was fine until puberty happened, lmao, I turned 12 and gained 20 pounds in less than a year. It came as a shock since both of my parents are slender and taught me and my brother to eat clean and all, but puberty does what it does. Kids teased me mercilessly, I cried in the bathroom almost every day during recess. As someone who\'s very dependent on friends and positive social interaction, you can imagine how hard it was on me as a friendless chubby 12-year-old victim of bullying. It served as a motivation, though, and I managed to lose weight by the time high school happened, so I had an opportunity to have a clean start. Years of bullying took their toll however and, even though I was no longer fat, I was anxious about meeting people and making friends, since my social skills were damaged at that point, but I still craved human interaction. I forced myself to push through my anxiety, but it wasn\'t until college that I finally learned how to talk to people again. So I don\'t think that it\'s impossible to change your perspective of people. If you don\'t want to, that\'s another story. But I know first hand what it\'s like, being disliked, bullied for being different and learning how to love people again. You seem to be happy with the way things are now, and that\'s cool, I respect that, so you don\'t need to change your perspective. My perspective was making me miserable so I decided to change it.\n\n> **My point is not to say this is definitely what extroverts do; I\'m saying it\'s how it** ***feels*** **to me, i.e. it feels like extroverts are ""interested"" in people as adults because of how it benefits them and not because they\'re just naturally interested**. \n\nOuch. Well, it can\'t be helped, if that\'s how you see it. I think that networking is a good thing. You help me, and I help you. I don\'t see it as taking advantage of other people. You do it because you enjoy it. But I\'m fine with agreeing to disagree.']"

This kind of behavior would be hard to miss, honestly. I think you\'re confusing extroversion for rudeness. Extroverts enjoy communicating, which is a two-way street. If I just wanted to hear myself talk, I\'d stay in front of the mirror all day, lol, I wouldn\'t need other people for that. I never talk over other people and I rarely dominate conversations. As I said, I care about getting to know people. Just talking to them wouldn\'t give me an opportunity to learn anything about them. Now, you talk about taking pauses before replying to someone. I don\'t know how much time you need to reply, for me, conversation usually comes in form of a steady flow. If you need more than five seconds to reply, people are naturally going to assume that you have nothing to say, and it sounds like a reasonable assumption to me. But I would feel the same if it\'s a one on one conversation as well.\n\n>the more people come into the mix, the more the quality of interaction seems to go down.\n\nIt\'s subjective, I guess. Depends on how one defines quality. Quality to me is proportional to the amount of fun I had, so any kind of setting can be good. Group conversations tend to be more cheerful and humorous, one on one tends to be more intimate as we discuss more delicate and personal matters. Both can be great and enjoyable to me.\n\n>So, it can be kind of offensive when extroverts want to bring other people into the mix.\n\nYou should let your friends know in advance, then. Chances are that they just think you\'d have more fun with more people around, not that you\'re not enough for them. But if they don\'t feel comfortable spending time with you only, then maybe the latter is the case. There is this one girl who always invites me out but I\'d rather avoid being alone with her because she expects me to take on the burden of leading the conversation and coming up with topics to discuss since I\'m ""better at it"". As I said, I don\'t enjoy monologue.\n\n>It\'s interesting you mention feeling lonely and insecure because a friend doesn\'t want to see you, though, because I feel like I\'m learning that extroverts feel rejected by introverts a lot when rejection was not meant **at all**.\n\nIt\'s one of those things that show us how different people can be. It\'s strange to me that introverts don\'t think of a possibility that saying no to someone who wants to spend time with you can come off as a rejection and hurt the extroverted one. That\'s why I think extroverts are better off with other extroverts, same as how introverts are better off with other introverts, simply because it\'s easier to reach the middle ground from the start. However, if two people have enough ""chemistry"" and care about making their friendship work, it shouldn\'t matter what they identify as. Friendship is work, after all.\n\nYou\'re welcome, and thank you too! I\'m enjoying myself discussing this.']"
0,E,"['>I just think it\'s a waste to wait around for an opportunity for someone  to reveal a personality trait that could make them interesting to me, as  it\'s mostly based on circumstance and that opportunity may never come.\n\nBut--and I think this goes for your story about bullying, too--do you understand that introverts just do not **need** social interaction, friendships, communities, personal connections, etc, in the same way extroverts do? For introverts, we\'re able to take years and years of negative experiences with people, and just be like, ""Okay, fuck people"" and be mostly fine in ways I don\'t think any extrovert ever could be. So, it makes all the sense in the world that you were miserable. We can meet a few people who seem like exceptions or a few people here and there who seem ""different"" from the other ""assholes"" or who seem intriguing, and then form relationships with those people and just forget about everyone else.\n\nOther than those exceptions, big deal if someone is friendly or shows interest in getting to know me, because I just don\'t need the amount of people or the amount of socializing extroverts or even ambiverts do. You might love people, but I probably love being by myself equally as much as you love people. And in fact, people are draining to me. So, for me to expend energy on other people, they have to bring more to the table than being friendly and receptive.\n\nI know most extroverts don\'t want to get to know everyone. I just feel like some extroverts think something is wrong with people who don\'t want to get to know as many people as they do, don\'t want to meet new people/friends of friends or who don\'t want to be friends with everyone in the office. It just seems to be a difference in social need that I don\'t think extroverts understand and ends up resulting in many of them feeling offended/rejected or threatened, as we\'ve somewhat started getting into discussing below. Truthfully, sometimes I would like to have friends to hang with--I can imagine the extrovert I mentioned to you in another response, both of us hanging out and having a good time together--but I can also deal with not having any friends whatsoever. It\'s one of the reasons it\'s so easy for me to never initiate anything socially, lol. I think it\'s a completely different story for extroverts.\n\nI usually don\'t get the sense when people approach me that they\'re networking. I tend to feel like they expect things from me that either would take more time for me to feel comfortable giving them or things that I feel have to develop in more organic ways than they seem to want to allow for. Not everyone can open up right away or do the ""instant friendship"" thing right off. Generally when I think about extroverts benefiting from social interactions, I tend to think about everything I discussed in the first few paragraphs of this response, i.e. they get the ""extrovert high"" they need...but sometimes they also seem to get this sense of community that they seem to need or this sense of belonging or whatever (like I said, stuff I don\'t understand, lol). I can\'t tell you how often I speak to people who are extroverts and we just seem to keep having the same conversations over and over again, i.e. they don\'t remember anything I tell them. It\'s as if they socialize and communicate just to get that extrovert high, not because they\'re interested in learning about me. And it\'s not all extroverts or all the time. Usually, I can tell them big things and they\'ll remember.\n\nAnyway, I am not saying the interest extroverts show or say they have in people is not real--although I honestly don\'t believe it usually is. But my not believing it\'s genuine doesn\'t mean it\'s not, and that\'s what I\'m trying to figure out.\n\nJust throwing this out there--another one of my big questions about extroverts is how to tell when one is romantically interested in you, just because of how extroverts do tend to act friendly with and interested in everyone. There\'s one I can\'t figure out if her behavior is just normal for her as an extrovert, or is she interested. I\'ve seen a lot of people say they will act different around you than they do with everyone else or they act more shy with you/they talk to everyone except you.']"
0,E,"['Oh, I am glad you\'re enjoying it! :) I was going to say you can stop responding at any time or don\'t have to answer all of my questions.\n\nMaybe more extroverted and ambiverted adults don\'t miss talking over other people and dominating conversations...but, as I said, we receive a lot of our messages when we\'re younger, and I think that\'s when people lack self-awareness, social consciousness and that kind of thing. So, we go through it so much over the years that, at some point, we just give up and assume that\'s how it will always go. Or I do, anyhow.\n\nAt my previous job, I did have more extroverted and ambiverted people try to pull me into conversations by specifically asking me what I thought.\n\nNow, if it\'s two of us talking to each other, I think that\'s different from a group of us talking. I definitely shut down more in groups and assume I will be talked over and that there will be too many people trying to speak, but I also definitely feel more like, ""Okay, you don\'t need me in this conversation"" because you have other people there to talk.\n\nExtroverts feeling rejected is definitely another really big topic/question I am very curious about. And if you\'re friends with an introvert and feel rejected if they say no to something, I can understand that better than situations I\'ve found myself in with co-workers, you know? In either case, though, one of the big reasons why I don\'t understand my saying no to something bothering an extrovert or making an extrovert feel rejected is because I\'m always thinking or assuming, ""Okay, they have plenty of friends, they can call someone else"" or ""They\'re not going to miss me, all of these other people will be there""...stuff like that.\n\nAnd then if we\'re not even friends and you\'ve invited me to this or that and I say no/don\'t come, that\'s even more so the case--particularly feeling like why would I be missed, we\'re not even friends/we barely know each other. This happens in work situations, and I\'m never sure if they\'re feeling rejected, their feelings are hurt or what the deal is. With work situations, I generally assume I\'m invited because they\'re inviting everyone else and want to be inclusive and not because they specifically want me to come. When I reject those invitations, I\'m really saying, ""Oh, you don\'t have to ask me--I\'m not going to feel left out, I know everyone else is closer/knows each other better than they know me."" So, the reactions I get after the fact are confusing to me. Depends on the workplace, though. When I left my previous job, this issue came up and I was told something like, ""I think everyone really wanted you to come,"" and...that\'s another one of those times where I wonder about whether or not that\'s genuine and why.\n\nAgain, I definitely can\'t speak for all introverts with this one, but you also have to think about how extroverts generally are more likely to initiate. I know I never really do any initiating, and you kind of touched on that before in one of your responses. So, I think a lot of introverts don\'t understand extroverts feeling rejected from that standpoint, either, just because we don\'t experience it or at least nowhere near as much.\n\nWould definitely love to see your thoughts (or anyone else\'s) on what I\'ve written about feeling rejected. Also just had another thought--I suggested I\'m more likely to say no if an extrovert invites me to something where there\'s ""too many people"" or depending on what kind of activity it is, which has **nothing** to do with wanting to spend time with him/her. Sometimes I just don\'t want to be a ""wet blanket,"" and I don\'t want the extrovert agreeing to do stuff when they\'d rather do something else. So, I might say no so that they can do what they want to do, and I assume they\'ll do it with someone else who will probably enjoy those people and/or that activity the same way the extrovert would. Basically, the perceived rejection is just not usually as personal as I think a lot of extroverts take it to be.']"

0,E,"['I will provide two scenarios.\n\nIf you don’t know this girl, or she doesn’t know you. \n\nYou wait for a time when you two can have a private conversation. You walk up, either compliment something about her, make an observation about the environment you are in (either a joke or something interesting), tell her something that will make her smile or think a little bit. Then introduce yourself, the way you introduce yourself is key, you must be inviting and make her want to tell you her name. The best thing to do after that is figure out something she likes, even if you hate it, and run with it. Let’s say she loves a type of music, a book, anything, literally anything she likes/loves. Get her to talk about it, act interested in it, make her seem like you genuinely care about what she is saying. Even if it’s something you totally hate. You can decide after if you want to have another conversation with her or not. Do not, and I repeat, do no talk about yourself or your own interest first. Ever. If she likes something you like then use that. Don’t be scared to tell a funny/cute/interesting sorry about it. Make it be something she can connect with. This will typically be the fastest way in the door and to a connection.\n\nIf it’s someone you know, but don’t normally talk too.\n\nThis is the much easier version. At this point, you know at least one interest she has. Could be a small interest or her favorite thing. Food, traveling, music, anything she’s interested in. Use this. Do a little research into something she likes and spark a conversation about it. Same style as before, let her do the talking in the beginning. Don’t put any input the conversation until she is completely done. After that show interest. Show you know a little bit about what it is you’re talking about. Even if it was just a google search you did 5min ago. Make her believe you’re interested in hearing about it, tell her you are interested in hearing about it, even if you aren’t. This will make her open up more to you.\n\n In both scenarios, if the conversation ends and it went well, don’t be scared to offer your contact information. If it’s a business card, Snapchat, even adding each other on Facebook. Make that connection. Shoot your damn shot, one of the best ways is making up an excuse to leave. Say this “Sorry, I really have to go! But I would love to continue this conversation over dinner/ coffee sometime?!” If you did well in the first steps, you will get her attention and by leaving, she will crave it. It’s all a mental game when it comes to this shit. Leaving on short notice makes her want to continue the conversation but you’re not allowing it, so she will want to keep talking to you. Just make sure you pull the plug before the conversation runs dry. Otherwise you will stand there awkwardly with nothing to say. Pull the plug at about 80% completion.\n\nGood luck my guy, takes lots and lots of practice.']"

I’d recommend searching for a community, like taking up lessons for something or joining a club. Meetup can even help you find other options too! It’s great if you’re on a tight budget. \n\nLearning to do things alone was very hard for me, but worth it! I’m pretty dependent on people, so when I moved like 6000 miles from my home, it was hard. My work schedule is also a late shift, and I have Sunday and mondays off! Mondays were always so lonely. But I started going out and doing things by myself. It was so awkward at first, but after awhile, I found myself enjoying it. Now I don’t even notice it. Of course I always invite my friends out, but if they can’t come, I’ll still go anyway! \n\nYou can also always immerse yourself in MMOs or moba or mmorpgs or something and play with your friends, since it is just 1 year. That’s a good option if you have a smaller budget every month/stuck in the house b/c of inadequate transportation. \n\nBut hey, going home after spending several years of your life in one place is very hard. Even if it’s one year, you gotta get used to it all over again. I’d only recommend trying one option. Take it slow and keep in touch with your buds during this time. That year will go by so fast.']"

For me it took a ton of trial and error but what I found to be consistent was that all of my hobbies and preferred ways of self care all fell under the spectrum of Words of Affirmation and Quality Time (two out of the five love languages. If you dont know what they are do give them a Google!)\n\nSo because I love words of affirmation and quality time... I have found that I love journaling in cafes. I love going to art galleries alone. Whenever I look at paintings I dont feel lonely? I feel deeply connected with the past with places far far away and histories so different from mine. I also go to these places happy to strike conversations with the people who work there. Youd be suprised what security guards and staff would have to say in the museums they work in.\n\nIf you are an Acts of Service person you can try volunteering at an animal shelter.

0,E,"['I am ENFP-T, which basically means I am an extrovert with many introverted tendencies. In a sense, we are two sides of the same coin. \n\nI was a very shy kid growing up, so things, like making friends and feeling confident around others, was hard for me at a young age. However, I am very curious and always love to improve, so I took things step by step. Here are the tips and tricks I use to get better at interacting and conversing with other people\n\n* Spark the conversation: Initiating conversation can be done in a number of ways, but I usually categorize this into 2 groups: directed or undirected. For directed initiation, you are focusing on a specific person with the intention of having a one-on-one with them. This might start with you complementing something about them, or asking them a question you think they could help you answer. For undirected initiation, you are saying something that could address multiple people around you. This usually involves commenting on something that is in the environment around you that others can share their thoughts on. \n\n* Dig deeper: This might seem obvious, but a lot of people get caught up in small talk and formalities, and this often makes the conversation feel forced or stale very quickly. Don\'t skip the introductions or small talk, but try not to spend too much time on these. Keep in mind that the purpose of the conversation is to connect with the person, and the best way to do that is to share personal opinions and thoughts, thereby opening a more engaging dialogue.\n\n* Talk about what interests you: After introductions and small talk, you\'ll have a general sense of who the person is and the major things going on in their life (academic major, job, defining interests, etc). If anything they mentioned or eluded to peaks your interest, ask about those topics. If what they have said so far seemed a bit uninteresting, then try introducing a topic you enjoy that you want to hear their thought on. \n\n* Take time to listen: It is important to not only give the other person time to talk about or respond to a topic in a conversation but also actively listen to what they say. \n\n* Try chatting online: The world we live in today allows us to be more connected than ever. You can try chat rooms, live chats on forums, online platforms like youtube or twitch, or reach out to people on social media and start up a conversation. The biggest benefit of talking online is that you can do it in your spare time, have more time to collect your thoughts, and can read over what you are going to say before sending a message to someone. And if you are chatting anonymously or to a stranger, it mitigates the feeling of ""messing up"" or being judged for practicing your conversational skills.\n\n* Practice make perfect: The more you talk with people, the easier it gets to initiate conversations, learn when to pause/continue, and to express what you want to say or know from the other person. \n\nI hope this helps. I\'ll try to add more tips as I remember them. Best of luck improving, and feel free to message me anytime with any questions!']"

They will feel more comfortable with you and YOU will feel more comfortable in reaction. \nIf you see them again, ask about news on a specific subject they tend to mention (you earn a lot of points that way).

Simply tell one they got to meet someone, bring it to the other, mention their common interest, and go get a drink. Both persons will feel listened, that you had a special attention for them and you will earn a lot of good will from them in just 2min of talking.\n \n\nIt's a skill, so it's trained and learnt, not a born with ability (even if it's much more difficult with autism).

I love coming home to my dogs, I can take them for walks and care for them! I will make them fancy dinners or interesting toys so that I can see them enjoying them. It makes me feel less alone. \n\nIn summation, for me, it's all about distraction.

I especially like reading books about improving my life & outlooks (self help books are somewhat my guilty pleasure). I’ve found that these make me excited for the future and all the possibilities instead of me sitting there thinking about how lonely it is. Going out in public just to be around people is a great distraction as well. Exercising always makes me feel good too. I guess what it really comes down to for me, is realizing that I’m not wasting time. I’m working on myself & that will never be a waste of time. You just have to find something that you can work on & improve in, whether that comes from the pursuit of a new hobby or whatever. Drink water, stand up straight, go outside as much as you can.

Friends had to sit me down and be like: ""yo, this isn\'t sustainable"" as you\'ve found.

Or sometimes even those friends you haven\'t talked to in a long time, I find that even inviting them over or calling/video-chatting while doing those mundane things really help. \n\nAlso, because of that need to ""hang out"", I actually have people come over to the house (when I cook, clean, etc.) and if it\'s like haven\'t cooked in awhile, I\'ll make a lot of food (make it into a hanging out time) and pack them leftovers, too! :) \n\nSometimes, not sure if this is a thing for you, mornings I have a list of people I check-in with (because that need to be with or talking to or anything...really...with people is real).

0,E,"['Here\'s some quick tips!\n\n\\-If you can, plan what you\'re going to say before hand.\n\n\\-You may feel the need to talk as quickly and succinctly as possible - people come across as much more confident and knowledgeable if they are comfortable with deliberate pauses and a slower pace when they speak. I assure you, you\'re voice sounds completely different to you than it does to everyone else! \n\n\\-Don\'t be afraid to tell stories or use metaphors / analogies. While conversations don\'t always *feel* substantial, they tend to ultimately be more about building a bond between people than conveying information. This is actually something I struggled with for a long time (switching from ""business mode"" to ""social mode,"" if that makes sense.\n\n\\-Ask ALL the questions! No need to interrogate people, but it\'s amazing what you can learn about people by asking them questions about what they are passionate about.

I notice a lot of extroverts who think they are introverts, but I don't see a lot of the opposite. Usually introverts know they're introverts and don't fight it. I hated that idea (even though I have what I think is very good self awareness, or at least the awareness to realize that I type a lot lmao) and wanted to do everything in my power to avoid being introverted, even if it means battling opioid and gabaergic addictions at 17 years old lmao. \n\nNow here I am, 19 years old; a social butterfly. TL;DR: I basically figured it out because I was confused as to why people liked me so much and it eventually came down to my sociability and charisma.""]"

0,E,"[""This may be completely different for other people but I have paid very specific attention to my extroversion for months now. As an extrovert I do experience weird anxiety if my needs are not met. Like I get very weird if I don't go out or do things with others x amount of times in a week. If i don't attend to this need I will get social/ separation/ safety anxieties. I think everyone has varied needs for connection and they get weird if they go under or over their range of needs regardless if they're extroverted or introverted. I thrive with crowds and being outgoing. If i fulfill that need in my life then I get to go about my every day s a mentally and emotionally healthy human.\n\nBeing an extrovert for me means that my range of needs for connection are higher and that my desire and ability to connect gives me energy. I can be extroverted AND uncomfortable being alone if I do not meet my extroversion needs in a week. So my goal is to meet my connection needs consistently so I don't get weird. But once I fulfill the need- I always get home happy. Ready with my mug of tea. I write on my journal. Do my self care. Meditate etc. and go to bed happy.\n\nYou could be extroverted/ introverted but have no confidence interacting with others by the way. Extro/introversion is a state of being. Ease of communication is a matter of skill and experience. Extroverts are also capable of finding solitude provided that they're self aware. You can be extroverted and still be comfortable with your own thoughts when you go home alone at night but it takes being able to cater to your needs and being mentally at ease with yourself.""]"

Something I notice about myself is that I am far more ready to engage in these things if I've spent a lot of the day around people: that kind of focus requires a lot of energy! I will become increasingly restless / uncomfortable if I am alone for longer periods of time (such as a full day), whereas I know some people (introverts) who have spent weeks with practically no social contact and been perfectly content!\n\nI tend to gauge the social balance in my life by *how* I spend my time alone.

0,E,"['I think it really depends. Like 60% of the population are extroverted and I don’t think that many people would be good at sales and management. People are individuals. Yes of course people will have many similarities because we are all the same species of animal. \n\nI like to read about Mbti, but it doesn’t tell the whole story. I’m an ENFP, but every ENFP is different. Some are really into doing sales, I personally would rather die. We’re only similar in the way that we like to brainstorm and tend to make decisions taking our feelings/values into account. And, everyone does that from time to time. Personality is a spectrum. We all have every trait. We just have some that we favor more than others.']"
0,E,"['I think how good you are at selling something also heavily depends on other factors rather than extroverted-ness (is that a word). It must also be taken into consideration how charismatic someone is, and if they are good at being persuasive.  Also extrovert doesn’t equal talkative, personally, while I do get energy from being around people, I don’t talk much unless I’m with people I’m comfortable with. So a salesperson could be extroverted, but last charisma or be shy at first, two things that usually turn a customer off from buying a product. Also, I am very much into mbti, if you ever want to talk about it just dm me... I don’t know too many people that are into it as well... and I need friends, I’m lonely. \nAlso what specifically don’t you agree about with the article and if you could send it that’d be nice, I want to see where the author is speaking from specifically. I do think that typically extroverts would be better at being a sales person because the job requires someone to be very social, and I don’t know many introverts that could do a job like that and not want to ducking die whilst working. Extroverts gain energy from people so typically their social skills will be better developed because we need more social interaction than introverts. But like I said before, being a good salesperson does also rely on other traits, but being naturally socially can really help a lot in that field. Also, if you actually read this, you should try to guess my mbti type without looking at my profile ;).']"

0,E,"[""The stereotype leans that way. Certainly there are *styles* of sales and management which fit extroverts better, and they're some of the more well-known ones... for obvious reasons.\n\nPersonally, I think the best salespeople and managers are those who are able to adjust their approach to best handle all kinds of people they interact with, regardless of where they might personally be on any particular spectrum.""]"

I myself become self conscious as if I\'m saying too much or being annoying. I just have to remind myself to earn certain people\'s trust. Sometimes I am suspicious of them though, for instance. When I met one of my best friends for the first time, she didn\'t immediately oggle and fall in love with me and my sense of humor. When someone doesn\'t fall for my charm immediately I\'m uncomfortable or suspicious.\nHOWEVER, if this person is my friend I probably know them inside-and-out.

ENTP\'s are able to replay scenarios in their head and imagine what might have happened that could have improved the situation, to be logged away for use at another similar setting. Because of the optimism combined with this, ENTP\'s have been known to be able to spend hours in their head, creating ideal situations and conversations out of a situation that may have gone wrong or not ideal.\n\n>If an ENTP is able to have his curiosity filled by something inanimate, he would feel no obligation or need to socialize. For instance, if computer programming happens to be on the mind of an ENTP, he could lock himself away for days figuring it out before he is too tired of being shut out from the world. An ENTP may even retreat into his own head IN a social setting if the social setting has no room for fascination or curiosity. It is because of all of this that most ENTP\'s and friends of ENTP\'s would be on the fence as to whether or not the ENTP is introverted or extroverted, as they can appear to be both. ']"

My sister likes having down time to process each session, so she does home based therapy, which requires more driving between sessions and a smaller client case load.

My Dad is introverted, and works for a sales company. He finds as much time as possible to do tech stuff for the company and has proven himself to be more useful in this way, so he sees less sales clients. He’s allowed to do this because he has proved he is more useful in tech. \n\nMore examples: Teachers could spend a little time talking, and give more silent reading or group assignments. Or have the students write in class. Or have the students be in groups to read info amongst themselves, and then each group present the material to the class.\n\n\nOr go to another field altogether if this doesn’t work in your given field.

0,E,"[""Don't know if I qualify as a lurking introvert as this is probably one of the mediums I come across quite extroverted - no one can interrupt my text.  That said, I will talk and I am going to talk about this issue as it comes up in late teens using a single case example.\n\nWhen I turned 17 (I think, maybe 18, Junior year of high school is what I am going for) my parents were insistent that I was going to go to prom.  This was an odd thing as they had never been like this before, though I secretly think it was more my mom's doing than my dad's.  It was an on again off again point of contention for about 8 months.\n\nFor context, and in there defense, I had attended dances in middle school.  What they didn't know was that I didn't dance there, nor did I date - I sat and talked with the few outcasts that were there.  In addition, I hated dancing, in fact I still do.  And added to that I don't like loud music - rock is awesome, but not at 2934857208 decibels (and this touches on the fact that I listen to music the way I listen to people, words matter - which means I am not a huge fan of dance music.\n\nWhy do I bother to type this, it isn't to gripe, it's because there were certain effects.  My relationship with my parents was strained.  I deliberately lied to and withheld information from my parents.  I developed a sort of disdain as opposed to neutrality towards school events, and by proxy my school and the students there.\n\nTo be clear, the problem wasn't my resistance toward new activities.  I have that, but can stand it from time to time.  The main problem was the fact that I had documented data saying I would dislike it, but was discounted for favor of cultural pressure of the ideal high school experience.  The end result was me lying about when prom was, by a month, and midway through painting our basement I let them know that was the day - and it was too late (immature move, but I was in high school).\n\nI write this as a warning.  When they say gentle pushing, that may mean making suggesting and accepting that will be the end of it.  Pushing them too far can break many relational bonds.""]"

My feelings have been hurt before due to that. Key is not letting it show that it bothers you. I know, I know, easier said than done.

It's not like they can call up Purchasing and order half a dozen socialites.\n\nOne thing which may be more generally successful is helping managers to both identify and provide support to employees across the whole spectrum. If they're *only* throwing their support efforts into supporting either introverts or extroverts, for instance, it's likely to result in employee dissatisfaction.

Then there are team-external factors such as ""the accounting team on the other side of the floor moved out and the sales team moved in"", or ""our new District Manager likes to visit and doesn\'t like seeing people chatting instead of staring at screens"".\n\nSo you\'d need something which could be recalculated/reassessed fairly swiftly when there was a change in the social fabric.
