Calling someone on the phone (usually a family member or friend) is not done with any intention of dominance or malice, it's initiating a conversation. The only time that is incorrect is if the topic of the conversation is to dominate or harm you in some way. Finally and maybe most important, every phone call comes with the implication that the person on the other end does not have to answer if they're busy or can't talk at the moment.""]"

The issue is a sudden unexpected phone call, without texting first.\n\nParents often do this, especially because they still see their kids as kids and not as adults. So according to them, randomly calling up or dropping by is not viewed as an intrusion.\n\nBut kids often have to cope up with this, because it's their parents and family. Children are also often guilted into be more accommodating of older family members even if the older family member is intrusive, entitled or have no boundaries.\n\nThis is especially hell for introverts, because receiving sudden phone calls with long conversations or sudden guests for dinner during our carefully planned recharge time, throws a wrench into everything.""]"

However, I also envy the energy of extroverts and their feeling to be part of society, it\'s something I wish naturally had.\n\nI joined this sub looking for good discussion and sharing insight with like minded people.

She suffers from depression and generalized anxiety, so it's not always within her control -- despite the fact that she has a healthy diet, exercises, meditates, and gets plenty of sleep. I also am guilty of being curt/sharp when i'm frustrated. Not always, but sometimes, and that makes her feel like I don't care and hurts her feelings. I don't do it intentionally, but sometimes it's difficult to control the tone of my voice. We just had a big fight a couple of days ago, and she said a couple of things to me that were (until that point) relatively mean and kind of out of character for her. They hit me like a ton of bricks and physically made me recoil. Now I cant be around her without hearing those words, or feeling a little bit of nausea because of my hurt feelings. I'm afraid to bring it up again because I dont want to open that can of worms again and argue again. We rarely argue and have NEVER argued like that. It was all because of a miscommunication and a lack of tact on my behalf. I'm sick to my stomach to think that these hurt feelings i've got are permanent. I just want to be able to heal my heart, and also be able to exist next to her without letting her moods affect mine. I want more than anything to have a harmonious relationship with her, where we can be strong for each other and take on any challenges together -- instead of seeing each other as the opponent.""]"
0,I,"['What you‚Äôre going through is far more common than you might think; you‚Äôre just very aware and articulate which makes it seem like a unique problem. I‚Äôm not minimizing your issue, I‚Äôm saying that it‚Äôs a real problem that happens often and has solutions.\n\nWhat you just described sounds a lot like how I used to be before I changed my views. I would start by recommending Jordan Peterson on YouTube. He‚Äôs a clinical psychologist from Toronto who has hours and hours of lectures that break down lots of modern issues and why people feel the way they do today and have since the beginning of consciousness.\n\nTone of voice is important, as well as inflection. People like myself are very easily swayed towards how we treat people based off how they sound when they talk to us (probably because my parents always fought when I was a child and they often blamed me to help forgive one another and move past it) so try and keep a calm, low voice when you think an argument might be coming. Avoid condescending and patronizing her; the goal is to show as few signs of irritation or annoyance as possible. This makes you a blank canvas for her to be herself towards. This might not be a good thing all the time, as per you specific issue but it simplified the issue because you‚Äôre not fuelling any fires or handing out ammunition.\n\nThe next thing I‚Äôd like to say is that it‚Äôs important for you to talk to her about whatever she said that hurt you so deeply. You haven‚Äôt specifically said what it is, and I don‚Äôt want you to because that tells me it‚Äôs something personal and hurtful. You need to find a good place and time to tell her that she genuinely hurt you with those words, and that you‚Äôre concerned about her current state of mind and how she deals with emotional situations because you want a future together forever and that can‚Äôt exist when one or both people aren‚Äôt trying. When my wife was my girlfriend, we had a fight over something similar to your issue and I said ‚ÄúIf you can‚Äôt even pretend to be excited about something for me once in a  while, why would I ever do that for you? This is ridiculous and so immature.‚Äù Her reply was ‚Äúwell I don‚Äôt know what to tell you, maybe you should find someone else.‚Äù And I replied, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want someone else, I want *you* and I want you to be the best you can be. Right now you‚Äôre not the best you can be, and I‚Äôll help you if you let me but I‚Äôm not giving up. If you want to give up, then give up, but love means you try.‚Äù - the point of this is that when you fight, in addition to making yourself a blank canvas, try to keep your responses filled with love. It sounds cheesy, but it will constantly remind her that you‚Äôre not there to be an enemy; you‚Äôre there to accelerate her already amazing personality.\n\nAsk her why she would say these things, and to confirm if this is truly what she means what she said. If she does, why does she feel this way and how can she justify it if she is to be your wife? If she doesn‚Äôt, then how can you help her live her life in such a way that if this chance arises for her again, *she wouldn‚Äôt take it*?']"
0,I,"['In regards to not letting her mood affect yours, *please* listen to what I‚Äôm about to tell you.\n\nBe. Her. Hero. ‚Äî Every healthy woman in a relationship needs a man who is both his own person, and whomever she needs him to be. What does that mean exactly? Have a personality, be yourself. That‚Äôs who she loves. ***But*** who you are is not always who she needs. So be that too. She‚Äôs having a bad day? And you *also* had a bad day? What justifies your existence right now? Feeling bad about your day? Or helping her forget she had a bad day at all? You knew the answer the moment you read the question. It‚Äôs part of what makes a good man irresistible to a woman. We are who we are, but when she needs a fireman to put out that fire, *be her fireman*. When she needs a shoulder to cry on, *be a sea of shoulders*.\n\nWhen a woman has that kind of support, you will find yourself happier. Not just because she‚Äôs happier, but because you‚Äôre *her hero*. It‚Äôs easy to be the victim, because we all get sick and we all die eventually. It‚Äôs easy to be the villain, because we already know that life is pain and we can always make it worse. But it‚Äôs hard to be the hero, because hero‚Äôs make choices we might not think to make.

I have detailed all the geography of my world, the history of magic going thousands of years, though in the world's present they don't have magic, but only yet, so i know future as well.

0,I,"['So there might be a long way ahead of you but I believe we all can make it.\n\nLet me first say that you don\'t fight social anxiety or any kind of anxiety by approaching it directly - you go through a series of realisations about yourself and the world and then the anxiety sort of eases of.\n\nThe most important thing for me was to stop defining myself in terms of my ego. The ego is a contruct of the psyche useful for survival and social situations but it is not all you are. In social situations usually the only thing that can get hurt is your ego - and the ego is so afraid of getting hurt that it will direct all your attention to protecting it, preventing your brain from working properly and not getting in its own way. If you let go of your ego you are no longer bothered by what other people think of you or say to you and you start to laugh at your own failures.\n\nThe ego also has a strong need to define itself, doesn\'t matter if it\'s in terms of good or bad. So it starts to define itself in terms of social anxiety. You find out that you are actually attached to your mental illness - the ego cannot imagine itself without it.\n\nThe second big thing for me was realising that often I notice people being uncomfortable around me the same way I am uncomfortable around them. But I know that I don\'t want to make others anxious. So I realised most people dont want to make me anxious as well and I can begin the interaction more relaxed as they are rarely as hostile or judging as I assume they might be.\n\n\nI suggest you read ""The wisdom of insecurity"" by Alan Watts if you haven\'t yet. It\'s a good place to start (you can also find a lot of recordings from his lectures on youtube and start there). It\'s pretty short and seemed to help a lot of people I met (and me). It doesnt tackle social anxiety directly but it will be helpful in that regard.']"

I understand not wanting to talk to people but that is not an excuse to go out of your way to avoid one. \n\nBeing introverted =/= afraid of phone. That is anxiety and not good, but you can grow beyond it with regular effort. If therapy works for you, great. If practice works for you, even better. Find what works for you and use it to grow beyond your limitations.""]"

Iv tested many times as an intp or intj, but kinda don't relate to the need for seclusion. I like my set of friends Iv studied and know, but I enjoy the idea of meeting people to test what iv learned via YouTube (I know) and to see how they react.
